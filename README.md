Issues Welcomed! ðŸ˜„

## NOTICE
This project is still **under developing**.

## Introduction
In the middle of 2015, I star using hexo as my blog framwork and make some pr for [hexo-theme-next](https://github.com/iissnan/hexo-theme-next). But with growing number of hexo users , I find more and more people choosing "hexo-theeme-next" as their defalut theme. Till now, "next" has become so pupular that makes it commonplace.

So, I decide to redesiginer my blog and build a brand-new theme. 

Take a look about the selection of development:

1. Gulp as build tool.
2. Browserify everything.
3. Stylus as css preprocessor 
4. Zepto for easier manipulation of DOM, also packed by browserify.
5. Using icon-font.

## Setup
	
Git clone and run gulp build

```bash
gulp build

```
